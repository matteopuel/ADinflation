# ADinflation

Code computing the scalar spectral index, scalar-to-tensor ratio, number of e-folding, transfer functions for the two-field inflationary model based on the Afflec-Dine potential with non-minimal coupling to gravity. The physics underlying this model is discussed in

## Structure
The main file is **ADinf.py**, which can be run in the usual way:
```
python ADinf.py
```
All the functions are defined in **myTools.py**. To run the Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo, use:
```
python MCMC.py
```
The plots are generated in **myPlots.py**.
